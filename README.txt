The FPoLi-GPCR (Fluorescence Polarization Ligand-GPCR binding) folder contains equations and ready to use example files and software to
analyze fluorescence polarization/fluorescence anisotropy based ligand binding experiments.

Contents:
SaturationBinding
	-SaturationBinding.pzfx                  - A GraphPad Prism v5 version file showing data organization and analysis parameters for the saturation binding experiments.
	-SaturationBinding.xml                   - A GraphPad Prism xml file showing data organization and analysis parameters for the saturation binding experiments.
	
	-SaturationBindingFP.txt                 - A simple text file with the saturation binding model equations, useful for implementing in software other than GraphPad Prism
	-SaturationBindingFP.m                   - A MATLAB version of the saturation binding model equations.

CompetitionBinding
