The FPoLi-GPCR (Fluorescence Polarization Ligand-GPCR binding) folder contains equations and ready to use example files and software to
analyze fluorescence polarization/fluorescence anisotropy based ligand binding experiments.

NB! Care must be taken when using pzfx and xml files as different versions of GraphPad Prism converge to different, sometimes ambiguous solutions. Use .pzf file for reference of original fits. If your Prism version fails to converge at particular conditions it may have to do with the way rounding of very small numbers is handled. When using the equations at these conditions/parameters care should be taken.
